# 🌾 Crop Prediction Web App using Flask & Machine Learning

This project is a Flask-based web application that predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on soil and weather conditions using a trained Machine Learning model.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Predict the best crop based on:
  - Nitrogen
  - Phosphorus
  - Potassium
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - pH
  - Rainfall
- 🧠 Uses a trained `RandomForestClassifier` model (`model.pkl`)
- 🌐 Responsive user interface built with Bootstrap 5
- 📦 Clean codebase with separate CSS and static files
